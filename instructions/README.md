**You may use AI tools** such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to assist with code and documentation

*   If you do this, explain in your Software Development Plan *which* tools were used, *where* they were used, and *how* they were used
*   Use comments to *clearly* identify which portions of source code were written by the tool
*   Failure to document use of these tools will be regarded as a **violation of academic integrity** and I will pursue sanctions
    *   The same goes for using other online resources

## How to Do This Project

Follow the shell tutorial's instructions closely.

This repository includes a Python program that's not fully functional yet, along with its documentation. It showcases DuckieCorp's coding and documentation standards. Your task is to resolve a bug in the program and complete its documentation. The bug's solution is disclosed as you progress through lesson `7-workflow.sh` in the Shell Tutor. Remember, attempting to fix the bug without following the tutorial means you're not doing it correctly!
